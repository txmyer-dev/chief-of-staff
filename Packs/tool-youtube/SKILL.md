  Fetch latest videos from YouTube channels and extract full transcripts.
  Two modes: channel mode (list recent uploads, needs YOUTUBE_API_KEY) and
  transcript mode (get full timestamped transcript from a URL, free via yt-dlp).
  Chain both to get the latest video's full transcript from any channel.
  Triggers on: "latest youtube video", "get transcript", "youtube transcript",
  "what did they post", "fetch from youtube", "channel updates".
  Used by other skills (mkt-content-repurposing) as a content source.
  Does NOT trigger for content creation, repurposing, or video editing.

# YouTube Tool

Utility skill for getting content out of YouTube. Two scripts, two jobs:

- **Channel mode** — find out what someone posted recently, list their latest videos
- **Transcript mode** — pull the full text from a specific video

Chain them together: find the latest video from a channel, then pull its transcript. Other skills (like `mkt-content-repurposing`) use this as a content source.

## Outcome

YouTube video metadata and/or full transcripts saved to `projects/tool-youtube/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{video-title-slug}.md`. Always save output to disk. This is not optional.

## Context Needs

None. This skill doesn't read brand context.

| File | Load level | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `context/learnings.md` | `## tool-youtube` section | Known issues, channel quirks |

## Dependencies

None — this is a base utility. Other skills depend on this one.

| Service | Key | Required For | Without It |
|---------|-----|-------------|------------|
| YouTube Data API v3 | `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | Channel mode (listing videos, resolving @handles, search) | Can't list channel videos. Transcript mode still works if you have the URL. |

Get a key at https://console.cloud.google.com/ (free tier is generous — 10,000 units/day).

## Step 0: Auto-Setup (runs once)

Before doing anything else, check if the required binaries exist. If either is missing, run the setup script — it detects what's missing and installs it automatically.

```bash
bash .claude/skills/tool-youtube/scripts/setup.sh
```

This installs `uv` (for digest.py's inline dependencies) and `yt-dlp` (for transcript extraction). Uses `brew` on macOS, falls back to `curl`/`pip` otherwise. Only needs to run once per machine — skip on subsequent calls if both binaries exist.

## Step 1: Determine the Request Type

| Request | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| "Latest videos from [channel]" | Channel mode — use digest script (Step 2) |
| "Transcript of [URL]" | Transcript mode — use transcript script (Step 3) |
| "Latest video transcript from [channel]" | Chain both — Step 2 then Step 3 |
| Another skill needs content | Provide the appropriate script output |

## Step 2: Channel Mode

Use the digest script to list recent uploads.

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/tool-youtube/scripts/digest.py --channels "@handle" --hours 48 --max-videos 5
```

This lists recent uploads with titles, dates, and URLs. Add `--transcript` to get a basic summary of each.

**Needs:** `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in `.env`. If missing, tell the user what it does and how to get one. Don't block — ask them to provide a video URL directly as the fallback.

**Script options:**

| Option | Default | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--channels` | — | Comma-separated @handles |
| `--search` | — | Comma-separated search queries |
| `--hours` | 48 | How far back to look |
| `--max-videos` | 10 | Cap on videos returned |
| `--transcript` | off | Include basic transcript summaries |
| `--output` | markdown | `markdown` or `json` |
| `--seen-file` | — | Track already-processed videos |
| `--api-key` | env var | Override YOUTUBE_API_KEY |

## Step 3: Transcript Mode

Use the transcript script for full text with timestamps.

```bash
python .claude/skills/tool-youtube/scripts/transcript.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --output-dir /tmp
```

Then read the output file. No API key needed — yt-dlp handles it.

**Script options:**

| Option | Default | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--lang` | en | Language code |
| `--format` | md | `md` (timestamped markdown) or `vtt` |
| `--output-dir` | . | Where to save the file |
| `--auto-only` | off | Only auto-generated subs |
| `--list` | — | List available subtitle tracks |
| `--check-setup` | — | Verify yt-dlp is installed |

## Step 4: Save Output

**Always save the transcript to the projects folder.** After extracting, create a clean version at `projects/tool-youtube/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{video-title-slug}.md`. The saved file format:

```
# {Video Title}

Source: {YouTube URL}
Channel: {channel name if known}
Date extracted: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Key Points

- {3-5 most important points from the video}

## Transcript

{Full transcript text with all timestamps removed — clean readable paragraphs only}
```

Strip all `**[HH:MM:SS]**` timestamps from the raw transcript before saving. The saved file should read like a document, not a subtitle track. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.

## Step 5: Collect Feedback

If used standalone, ask: "Got the transcript. Anything else you need from this video or channel?"

Log feedback to `context/learnings.md` → `## tool-youtube`.

## Rules

*Updated automatically when the user flags issues. Read before every run.*

---

## Self-Update

If the user flags an issue — wrong channel, bad transcript, missing data — update the `## Rules` section immediately with the correction and today's date.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Setup script fails**: If `brew` isn't available, the script falls back to `curl` (for uv) and `pip` (for yt-dlp). If both fail, tell the user to install manually.
- **No API key**: Channel listing won't work. Transcript mode still works with direct URLs. Tell the user how to get a key and offer the URL fallback.
- **yt-dlp not installed**: Run `bash .claude/skills/tool-youtube/scripts/setup.sh` — it auto-installs. If that fails, `brew install yt-dlp` manually.
- **No transcripts available**: Some videos don't have captions. The script will say so. Suggest the user paste a transcript manually.
- **Channel not found**: The @handle might be wrong, or the channel might be very new. Try searching by name instead of handle.
