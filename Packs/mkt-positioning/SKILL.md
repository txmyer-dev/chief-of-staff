description: >
  Find the angle that makes something sell. Use when launching a product,
  writing a landing page, crafting an offer, or when marketing feels flat.
  Searches competitor messaging to map the landscape, loads brand context,
  then generates 3-5 distinct positioning angles with a recommended pick.
  Writes chosen angle to brand_context/positioning.md. Optionally seeds
  an ad testing matrix. Triggers on: "find angles for", "how should I
  position", "what's the hook", "why isn't this selling", "make this stand
  out", "differentiate", "USP", "positioning". Foundation skill — run
  before execution skills that need an angle to write from.
  Does NOT trigger for voice extraction, audience research, or content writing.

# Positioning

The same product can sell dramatically better with a different angle. Not a different product — just a different way of framing what it already does. This skill finds those angles.

## Outcome

`brand_context/positioning.md` containing: primary positioning angle, competitive landscape summary, market sophistication assessment, and all explored alternatives.

The structured data format is defined in `references/positioning-output.md`.

## Context Needs

| File | Load level | How it shapes this skill |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `brand_context/icp.md` | Full | Audience segments, pain points, and language patterns inform angle generation |
| `brand_context/voice-profile.md` | Tone only | Ensures angle language matches brand register |
| `context/learnings.md` | `## mkt-positioning` section | Apply previous feedback on what converted |

Load if they exist. Proceed without them if not.

## Before You Start

**Check if `brand_context/positioning.md` exists.**

If it exists → **Update mode.** Read the file, show the current primary angle and statement, and ask: "Want to refine this with fresh competitive data, or start from scratch?" Refine mode runs a fresh competitive search and suggests adjustments. Start fresh runs the full process below.

If it doesn't exist → proceed to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Identify the Transformation

Not the product. The transformation. What does the customer's life look like after? What pain disappears? What capability appears?

Ask: "What does your customer's life look like after using this? What changes?"

A fitness program sells "fit into your old jeans." A SaaS tool sells "close your laptop at 5pm." The transformation is the raw material for angles.

---

## Step 2: Map Alternatives

What would customers do if this didn't exist? Not just competitors — all alternatives:
- Do nothing (live with the problem)
- DIY (cobble together a solution)
- Hire someone (consultant, freelancer, agency)
- Buy a different category entirely
- Buy a direct competitor

Each alternative has weaknesses. Those weaknesses become angle opportunities.

---

## Step 3: Competitive Messaging Search

Search the web for real competitor messaging. This grounds angles in current market reality.

Read `references/competitive-search.md` for the full search process and landscape map format.

Key output: a map showing saturated claims (everyone says it), partially claimed territory, and white space (nobody is talking about it). Angles built on white space outperform echoed claims.

---

## Step 4: Assess Market Sophistication

Read `references/market-sophistication.md` for Schwartz's 5 stages.

The market stage determines which angle type will work. A new category needs simple announcement. A crowded market needs mechanism explanation. A jaded market needs identity framing.

---

## Step 5: Generate Angles

Run the product through multiple angle frameworks. Read `references/angle-frameworks.md` for the full set (Contrarian, Unique Mechanism, Transformation, Enemy, Speed/Ease, Specificity, Social Proof, Risk Reversal).

Generate 3-5 distinct options. For each:
- **Statement** — one sentence positioning
- **Psychology** — why this works with this audience at this market stage
- **Headline direction** — how it would sound in copy
- **Best for** — market conditions and audience segments

Mark one with a recommendation and explain why it's the strongest fit given their competitive white space and market stage.

Ask: "Which angle resonates? Pick a number, or tell me to combine elements from multiple."

---

## Step 6: Validate Before Saving

For each angle, verify:
1. Is it specific? ("Better results" fails. "20 lbs in 6 weeks" converts.)
2. Is it differentiated? Cross-reference the competitive landscape — if a competitor already claims it, sharpen further.
3. Is it believable? Does the mechanism or proof support it?
4. Is it relevant to THIS audience? If icp.md is loaded, verify alignment.
5. Does it lead somewhere? Can you picture the headline, the landing page, the ad?

---

## Step 7: Save Output

After the user selects an angle, write `brand_context/positioning.md`.
Read `references/positioning-output.md` for the exact format.

If the file already existed, show what changed and confirm before overwriting.

After saving, offer: "Want me to generate a 12-ad testing matrix for this angle? I'll map 4 hooks across 3 formats."

---

## Step 8: Collect Feedback

Ask: "How did this angle perform once you used it?"
Log feedback to `context/learnings.md` under `## mkt-positioning` with date and context.

---

## Rules

*Updated automatically when the user flags issues. Read before every run.*

---

## Self-Update

If the user flags an issue with the output — wrong angle, bad framing, missed competitive signal, incorrect assumption — update the `## Rules` section in this SKILL.md immediately with the correction and today's date. Don't just log it to learnings; fix the skill so it doesn't repeat the mistake.

---

## Troubleshooting

**User can't articulate the transformation:** Ask what their best customers say about the product — the transformation is in their words, not the founder's.
**No competitors found:** The product may be category-creating (Stage 1). Lead with simple announcement angles.
**All angles feel similar:** The mechanism isn't clear enough. Go back to Step 1 and dig deeper on what makes their approach different.
**Positioning exists but feels stale:** Run a fresh competitive search and compare — the market may have moved.
