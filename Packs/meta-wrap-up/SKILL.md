name: meta-wrap-up
description: >
  End-of-session checklist that reviews deliverables, collects feedback,
  fixes skills, updates learnings, and commits work. Triggers
  AUTOMATICALLY when the user signals session end: "thanks", "that's it",
  "done for today", "bye", "I'm done", "all good", "that's all",
  "cheers", "signing off", "wrap up", "close session", "end session",
  "we're done", "session done", or invokes /wrap-up. Also runs at the
  end of any working session or after completing a major deliverable.
  Does NOT trigger for content writing, voice extraction, positioning,
  or audience research. Does NOT trigger for mid-conversation "thanks"
  that clearly mean "thanks, now do X" rather than session end.

# Wrap-Up

End-of-session checklist. Four steps: review what was done, collect feedback, apply fixes, commit everything.

## Outcome

- Updated `context/learnings.md` with session feedback
- Updated `context/memory/{today}.md` with session log (4-section format)
- Updated `context/USER.md` if new preferences were observed
- Proposed `context/SOUL.md` updates if behaviour corrections were observed
- Direct fixes applied to any skills that need them
- CLAUDE.md Skill Registry, Context Matrix, and README.md synced with any new or removed skills/MCPs
- Clean git commit of all session work
- Session summary presented in consistent format

## Context Needs

| File | Load level | How it shapes this skill |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `context/learnings.md` | `## meta-wrap-up` section | Check for previous wrap-up insights |
| `context/USER.md` | Full | Check if preferences need updating |
| `context/SOUL.md` | Full | Check if behaviour rules need updating based on session corrections |
| All `brand_context/` files | Scan only | Identify which files were created or modified this session |

Load if they exist. Proceed without them if not.

---

## Step 1: Review Deliverables

Scan what happened this session:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see all changes
2. List every file created or modified, grouped by location:
   - `brand_context/` — foundation files written or updated
   - `projects/` — deliverables produced
   - `.claude/skills/` — skills created or modified
   - Other locations — flag for file placement check
3. **File placement check:** Verify outputs follow naming conventions:
   - Projects in `projects/{category}-{output-type}/` with correct prefix
   - Filenames use `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{descriptive-name}.md` format
   - If anything is misplaced or misnamed, fix it now

---

## Step 2: Collect Feedback

Ask the user three questions (skip any that don't apply to the session):

1. **What worked well?** — Anything the skills produced that hit the mark
2. **What didn't work?** — Anything that missed, needed heavy editing, or frustrated you
3. **Any specific skill issues?** — Did a skill take the wrong approach, miss context, or produce the wrong format?

If the session was short or routine, one question is enough: "Anything to note before I wrap up?"

---

## Step 3: Apply Changes

Two types of updates based on the feedback:

### 3a: Update Learnings

Log feedback to `context/learnings.md`:
- Skill-specific feedback → `# Individual Skills` → `## {skill-folder-name}` section
- Cross-skill patterns → `# General` → `## What works well` or `## What doesn't work well`
- **Dedup guard:** Before appending, scan the skill's section for duplicate entries. If the same lesson already exists, skip or update the date.

Each entry format:
```
- {YYYY-MM-DD}: {What happened and what was learned}
```

### 3b: Fix Skills Directly

If feedback points to a specific skill issue — wrong approach, missing step, bad default, missing context — **edit the SKILL.md or reference file directly**. Don't just log it; fix it.

Examples of direct fixes:
- Skill missed a step → add the step to SKILL.md
- Wrong output format → update the format instructions
- Skill should have loaded context it didn't → update Context Needs table
- A reference file has outdated guidance → edit the reference

After applying fixes, log what was changed in the skill's learnings section so there's a record.

### 3c: Finalise Daily Memory

One file per day: `context/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. The heartbeat (or `/start-here`) creates the session block at the start. Wrap-up **finalises the existing block** — it does NOT create a new session block.

**Find the current session's `## Session N` block** and replace any placeholder text with real content from the session. Fill in all four sections:

```
## Session N

### Goal
[One line — what the user set out to do]

### Deliverables
- `path/to/file` — what it is

### Decisions
- [Decision and rationale]

### Open threads
- [Anything unfinished for the next session]
```

**Rules:**
- **Never append a new session block** — wrap-up completes the block that was started, it doesn't create a new one
- **Never leave placeholder text** like `[Waiting for user goal]`. Replace placeholders with actual content from the session
- Omit sections that don't apply (e.g., no Decisions section if none were made)
- If no session block exists yet (e.g., heartbeat was skipped), create one — but this is the fallback, not the norm

### 3d: Evolve SOUL.md (agent-suggested, user-approved)

Review the session for behaviour corrections — moments where the user pushed back, corrected your approach, or expressed frustration with how you handled something. If a correction points to a missing or wrong rule in `context/SOUL.md`, **propose the change to the user**:

- Tell them what you observed: "You corrected me twice about X"
- Show the proposed SOUL.md edit (the specific line to add/change)
- Only apply it if they approve

Most sessions won't trigger this. Only propose changes for patterns, not one-off corrections. This keeps SOUL.md sharp over time without silent rewrites.

### 3e: Update User Preferences

If you noticed new patterns about how the user works — communication style, preferred formats, feedback cadence, working hours — update `context/USER.md`. Don't ask permission for small additions to the Notes section; do ask before changing core preferences.

### 3f: Skill & MCP Sync

Run the reconciliation described in CLAUDE.md's **Skill & MCP Reconciliation** section. This catches anything that changed during the session:

1. **Skills** — compare `.claude/skills/` folders against CLAUDE.md's Skill Registry and Context Matrix:
   - New skill folder not yet registered → add to CLAUDE.md Skill Registry, Context Matrix, README.md skill tables, and `context/learnings.md`
   - Registered skill whose folder was deleted → ask user: "Remove `{skill-name}` from CLAUDE.md Skill Registry, Context Matrix, README.md, and context/learnings.md?"

2. **External services** — for any new or modified skills, scan for API key dependencies (see CLAUDE.md § External service detection). Auto-add any new services to:
   - CLAUDE.md Service Registry table
   - `.env.example`
   - README.md External Services table

3. **MCPs** — compare `.claude/settings.json` MCP entries against README.md:
   - New MCP not documented → add to README.md Connected Tools section
   - Documented MCP removed from settings → ask user: "Remove `{mcp-name}` from README.md?"

Log any sync actions in the session summary under a **Registry sync** line.

---

## Step 4: Commit & Push

1. Stage all changes from the session (deliverables, brand context updates, skill fixes)
2. Commit with a descriptive message summarising the session's work
3. Push to remote

---

## Session Summary

After all steps, present a summary in this exact format:

```
--- Session Summary ---

Deliverables:
- {file path} — {what it is}
- {file path} — {what it is}

Learnings logged:
- {skill-name}: {one-line summary of what was logged}
- General: {one-line summary if cross-skill insight was added}

Skills modified:
- {skill-name}: {what was changed and why}
  (or "None" if no skills were modified)

Registry sync:
- {what was added/removed from CLAUDE.md, README.md, context/learnings.md}
  (or "No drift detected")

Memory:
- Daily log: context/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
- SOUL.md: {proposed change, or "No evolution needed"}
- User prefs: {what was updated in context/USER.md, or "No changes"}

Committed: {commit hash} — {commit message}
---
```

If no deliverables were produced (e.g., session was planning or discussion only), note that instead.

---

## Step 5: Show Usage

After the session summary, tell the user to run `/usage` to check their plan usage, limits, and remaining capacity. This is a built-in CLI command that must be typed by the user — it cannot be invoked programmatically by the agent.

---

## Rules

*Updated automatically when the user flags issues. Read before every run.*

- 2026-03-10: Daily memory file must contain real content, never placeholders. One file per day with `## Session N` blocks. Always fill in the goal and what happened — don't leave heartbeat scaffolding as-is.

---

## Self-Update

If the user flags an issue with the wrap-up process — wrong commit scope, missed files, bad summary format — update the `## Rules` section in this SKILL.md immediately with the correction and today's date. Don't just log it to learnings; fix the skill so it doesn't repeat the mistake.

---

## Troubleshooting

**User has no feedback:** Log "No feedback — routine session" with date to the relevant skill section. Still do the file placement check and commit.
**Multiple skills used in one session:** Collect feedback per skill. Log to each skill's section separately.
**User wants to skip steps:** That's fine — the minimum useful wrap-up is Step 3a (update learnings) + Step 4 (commit). Always do at least those two.
